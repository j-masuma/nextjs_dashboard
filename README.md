## To improve the navigation experience to dynamic routes, you can use streaming.
Streaming is a data transfer technique that allows you to break down a route into smaller "chunks" and progressively stream them from the server to the client as they become ready.
suspense
loading
## request waterfall
## parallel data fetching
## static and dynamic rendering
## combine static rendering, dynamic rendering, and streaming in the same route with Partial Prerendering (PPR).

## debouncing is a programming practice that limits the rate at which a function can fire. In our case, you only want to query the database when the user has stopped typing.-----using debounce library

## zod------ a TypeScript-first validation library
So, authentication checks who you are, and authorization determines what you can do or access in the application.
